The Login Page is a simple and responsive login form designed using HTML and CSS. It features a clean and modern layout with input fields for username and password, along with a submit button. The design adapts to different screen sizes for a smooth experience across devices. The page is styled with CSS to create a user-friendly interface, including minimalistic form elements, intuitive spacing, and interactive hover effects on the button. This project provides a foundation for building login pages that can be further enhanced with JavaScript and server-side integration.
